## Good ol' mtcars {.build}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

- What are the dimensions?
- What type of data is in each column?

![mt](mt.jpg)


## Representation one: a dataframe {.build}


```{r}
class(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
apply(mtcars, 2, class)
```


## Representation two: a list {.build}


```{r}
mode(mtcars)
length(mtcars)
```


## Data Type Ecosystem {.build}

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | (Data frame)  |
| nd | Array         |               |

# Lists

## Lists {.build}

*Everything in R is a vector*

...except maybe **lists**.

Lists are heterogenous: can contain elements of any mode/type and length

- numerics/double/fp
- integer
- string
- logical
- lists


## Lists {.build}

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
str(x)
is.list(mtcars)
is.list(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))
```

## Lists {.build}

```{r}
str(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))
```

## Subsetting lists {.build}

*If list x is a train carrying objects, then x[[5]] is the object in car 5; x[4:6] is a train of cars 4-6.*

â€” @RLangTip

`[]` extracts the coarsest elements of the list up to the `length()`, but remains a list.

`[[]]` extracts the actual object from the list in its original mode/type.


## Subsetting lists {.build}

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
x[1]
x[[1]]
```

How would you extract the `FALSE`?


## Unlist {.build}

Since lists don't simplify when subsetted, you need to use `unlist()` if you want to flatten them into a vector.

```{r}
unlist(x)
```



## ... {.build}

- The ellipsis is used to pass additional named or unnamed arguments to a function.
- Most often used to pass parameters to a function called by your function.
- You can access these arguments by putting them into a **list**.

```{r}
HelloWorld <- function(...) {
  arguments <- list(...)
  paste(arguments)
}

HelloWorld("Hello", "World", "!")
```

# Dataframes

## Dataframes {.build}

- List of equal-length vectors.
- 2-dimensional structure.
- Shares properties of both matrix and list.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3,
                 y = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(df)
```


## Dataframes {.build}

1. What `attributes()` does this dataframe have?
2. What happens when you convert this dataframe into a matrix?

```{r}
attributes(df)
```


## Dataframes {.build}

```{r}
as.matrix(df)
```


## Subsetting {.build}

`$` is an operator used to access a column from a dataframe.

and it can do partial matching.

```{r}
x <- data.frame(abc = 1)
x$a
```


## Subsetting {.build}

Similarly to vectors, you can subset with indices or logicals.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1,
                 z = letters[1:3])
df[df$x == 2, ]
df[c(1, 3), ]
```


## Since dataframes are lists... {.build}

What is returned by `mtcars[1]`?
```{r}
mtcars[1]
```


## Since dataframes are lists... {.build}

What is returned by `mtcars[[1]]`?
```{r}
mtcars[[1]]
```


## {.build}

I've shown you two operators that essentially subset a data frame in the same manner. What are they?

`$` and `[[]]`.

Only difference: `$` does partial matching, `[[]]` does not.


## Subsetting (matrix + list){.build}

You can subset as a matrix or a list:
```{r}
df[, c("x", "z")]
df[c("x", "z")]
```


## Subsetting (matrix + list) {.build}
However, note that matrix subsetting simplifies; list does not.

```{r}
str(df[, "x"])
str(df["x"])
```


## Subsetting {.build}

Slice an element out of a vector or pick out an element from a full matrix.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1,
                 z = letters[1:3])
df$z[3]
df[3,3]
```


## {.build}

Fix the following subsetting errors using data from `data(mtcars)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
mtcars[-1:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]
```


## Dataframe takaways {.build}

- Central structure in R for multivariate data.
- Lots of functions and packages work in dataframes.
- Lots of metadata.
- Encourages tiny data and clean analysis.
- Can be slow.
