## What is style? {.build}

## Style guide {.build}
Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read. As with styles of punctuation, there are many possible variations.

The particular style in use is less important than having **consistent** style.


## Packages to help {.build}

1. `formatR`: brings code from messy to pretty good.
2. `RLint`: brings code into line with Google style.

. . . but better to do it right the first time.


# Notation and naming

## File names {.build}

File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`.

```
# Good
fit-models.R
utility-functions.R

# Bad
foo.r
stuff.r
```

If files need to be run in sequence, prefix them with numbers:

```
0-download.R
1-parse.R
2-explore.R
```

## Object names {.build}

- Variable and function names should be lowercase.
- Use an underscore (`_`) to separate words within a name.
- Generally, variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs.
- Strive for names that are concise and meaningful (this is not easy!).


## Object names {.build}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
dayone
djm1
```


## Object names {.build}

Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables. This will cause confusion for the readers of your code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
```


# Syntax

## Spacing {.build}

- Place spaces around all infix operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.).
- Same rule applies when using `=` in function calls.
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```


## Spacing {.build}

There's a small exception to this rule: `:`, `::` and `:::` don't need spaces around them.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 1:10
base::get
# Bad
x <- 1 : 10
base :: get
```

Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
plot(x, y)
# Bad
if(debug)do(x)
plot (x, y)
```


## Spacing {.build}

Extra spacing (i.e., more than one space in a row) is ok if it improves
alignment of equal signs or assignments (`<-`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list(
  total = a + b + c, 
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)
```


## Spacing {.build}

Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless there's a comma, in which case see above).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
diamonds[5, ]

# Bad
if ( debug ) do(x)  # No spaces around debug
x[1,]   # Needs a space after the comma
x[1 ,]  # Space goes after comma not before
```


## Curly braces {.build}

- An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line.
- A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it's followed by `else`.
- Always indent the code inside curly braces.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}
```


## Curly braces {.build}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}
```

It's ok to leave very short statements on the same line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

## Line length {.build}

Strive to limit your code to **80 characters per line**. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find yourself running out of room, this is a good indication that you should encapsulate some of the work in a separate function.


## Indentation {.build}

- When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.
- The only exception is if a function definition runs over multiple lines. In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}
```


## Assignment {.build}

Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment.

```{r}
# Good
x <- 5

# Bad
x = 5
```


# Organisation

## Commenting guidelines {.build}

- Comment your code. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol 
and a single space: `# `. Comments should explain the why, not the what.
- Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your file into easily readable chunks.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```

##  {.build}

Please rewrite the following code with style:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for(x in 1:7){print(x); x = x+1; if (x==5) break;}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (x in 1:7) {
  x
  x <- x + 1
  if (x == 5) break
}
```
