## Objective
Your job is simple (?): use the data available to gain insight into the process of the hoteling and the sharing economy. Your final product will
be four slides (feel free to use markdown ioslides, R presentations, keynote, google
slides, etc.).

A suggested strategy is the following:

- **Get the lay of the land** by getting a sense of the data available and doing exploratory 
data analysis.
- **Identify** the 1-3 topics/questions that you find most interesting.
- **Formulate** a possible visualization/statistic/ranking that will address
the questions.
- **Diagram** a pathway to get from the raw data to the final data product.
