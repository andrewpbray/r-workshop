```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE,message=FALSE)
```

The following link will load the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load(url('http://www.stolaf.edu/people/olaf/cs125/project1.RData'))
```

#### Recall:

- The first element of the vector corresponds to the average temperature 
in January of 1881. The second element is February 1881, etc. The last element is December 2012.
- Each element in the vector is the scaled deviation (by 100) from a baseline mean 
global temperature in Celsius. The baseline mean global temperature is the 
global temperature from 1951-1980, which is 14.0o C (57.2o Fahrenheit).
- For data details, read the bottom of the Nasa page:

#### Some requests

- If there are some tasks that you can imagine needing to code up again, *write a 
function for it*.
- Your final html document should read like an informative analysis of this
temperature data set meant to be be consumed by a non-programmer. That is,
    - Supress R code (though an exception may be easy-to-read output).
    - The narrative should be as in a natural analysis; not as a collection of
    enumerated answers to exercises.
    - Use sensible Markdown sytax for organization.
    - Fiddle with "knitr chunk options" to get the figures you're going for.
- Your source, however, should be crystal clear to another programmer.
    + Code with style.
    + Label your chunks.

Please complete the following exercises using R vectors:

1.   Convert the data from scaled deviation in Celsius to absolute temperature in 
Fahrenheit. What is the mean temperature in Fahrenheit over the entire data set? 
Confirm that your result is reasonable. Use your new Fahrenheit vector for the 
rest of the exercises.

1.   Find the mean global temperature of each the summer months: June, July, and August. Also please find the lowest and 
highest global average temperatures for each month. This is easiest if you create new 
vectors that have all June temperatures, all July temperatures, and so on. 
When did the lowest and highest occur for each month? Are the highest temperatures 
generally more recent than the lowest temperatures?

1.   For the rest of the project, it will be helpful to define two functions. 
Define one function that takes the month and year as input and outputs the index in 
the vector for that given month and year. Define another function that takes the index 
in the vector as the input and outputs the month and year.

1.   Create plots of the monthly average temperature over time for each month: 
one plot for all January average temperatures, one plot for all February average 
temperatures, etc. To make a plot with a single vector, use the `plot()` function.
The plots should have *Years* on the horizontal axis, and *Temperature* on the vertical 
axis. Does there seem to be a warming trend? The previously defined functions will 
be helpful here.  Feel free to fiddle with the optional arguments to `plot()` (more
are found with `?par`).

1.   Create a plot that shows the average annual temperature over all years. 
(That is, create one plot where each data point corresponds to the average temperature 
for a year.) In what years did the highest and lowest average temperatures occur?

1.   Create a plot showing the monthly average temperature starting at January 
2000 (one plot showing all data points from January 2000 through December 2012). 
Do you see any pattern to the data? Are temperatures rising? The previously defined 
functions will be helpful here.

1.   Create a plot of the monthly average temperatures starting at January 1990 
and ending on December 1999. Do you see any pattern to the data? Are temperatures 
rising? Which months had the highest and lowest temperatures?

1.   Plot the monthly average temperature of every month in the 1890s. What is 
the mean temperature of this decade? How does this decade compare to the 1990s?

1.   Create plots of the monthly averages of the first 44 years, the second 44 
years, and the last 43 years. Do you see any warming trends in any of these 
plots? What is the average temperature of each of these time periods? Remember 
to use the previously defined functions!
