## Contructing a matrix {.build}

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2,
            byrow = TRUE)
m
```


## Matrices {.build}

*Everything is a vector.*

```{r}
m
length(m)
dim(m)
```


## Matrices {.build}

*Everything is a vector.*

- Must be homogenous (e.g. all numerics).
- Treated like a vector with an extra dim attribute.

```{r}
attributes(m)
```

- Matrix operations are fair game.


## Matrix operations {.build}

- transpose: `t()`
- determinant: `det()`
- inverse: `solve()`
- inner product: `%*%`


## Matrix subsetting {.build}

Subset with `[rows, columns]`.

```{r}
m[1:2, 2]
m[m > 3 & m < 6]
```


## Matrix FYI {.build}

```{r}
rownames(m) <- c("a", "b", "c")
colnames(m) <- c("green", "blue")
m
m[, "green", drop = FALSE]
```
